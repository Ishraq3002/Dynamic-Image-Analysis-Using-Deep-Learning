# PyTorch Image Classification Project

**Developed By:** Md Ishraq Tanzim

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a simpler neural network model for image classification using PyTorch. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization techniques to effectively classify images and analyze model performance.

## Features
- CNN and simple neural network models for image classification.
- Data preprocessing for PyTorch compatibility.
- Model training and evaluation using accuracy metrics.
- Visualization of image data and classification results.

## Dependencies
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- scikit-learn

## Repository Contents
- `ImageClassifier.py` - Main script for training and evaluating the image classification model.
- `TrainingDataset.csv` - Dataset file used for training the model.
- `ValidationDataset.csv` - Dataset file used for validating the model's performance.
- `requirements.txt` - Lists all the Python dependencies required for this project.


## Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/Ishraq3002/Dynamic-Image-Analysis-using-Deep-Learning
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To train and evaluate the model, run:
```
python ImageClassifier.py
```
Ensure you have the training and validation datasets in the project directory before running the script.

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the models or extend the project's capabilities are welcome. Please submit a pull request or open an issue for discussion.
